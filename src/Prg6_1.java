/*
 Prg6-1 Design and implement a chat system
 Design and implement a chat system that allows multiple groups of users to chat. A chat
 coordinator resides at a well-known network address, uses UDP for communication with chat
 clients, sets up chat servers for each chat session, and maintains a chat session directory.
 There is one chat server per chat session. A chat sever uses TCP for communication with clients.
 A chat client allows users to start, join, and leave a chat session. Design and implement the
 coordinator, server, and client code.
